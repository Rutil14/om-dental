      question: "Are your dental treatments really pain-free?",
      answer: "We use state-of-the-art computerized sedation delivery (The Wand) and dental laser systems instead of traditional drills. This minimizes tissue damage and ensures comfortable, practically pain-free dental procedures."
    },

      question: "What is digital smile designing, and how does it work?",
      answer: "Digital Smile Designing (DSD) is a treatment planning methodology that uses 3D facial photos and digital scans to analyze dental proportions. Before starting any treatment, we generate a high-def 3D mockup showing exactly how your teeth will look, allowing you to preview and co-design your final smile."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do porcelain veneers last?",
      answer: "Premium porcelain veneers typically last between 10 to 15 years, and in many cases even longer, if maintained with proper oral hygiene and regular clinical checkups."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you accept dental insurance?",
      answer: "Yes, we work with major healthcare and dental insurance providers. Our administrative team will help you verify your coverage and submit claims directly to maximize your benefits."

      question: "How do I schedule an emergency appointment?",
      answer: "For emergency care, please call our 24/7 hotline at +91 98765 43210. Emergency calls bypass standard queues and are immediately routed to our on-call specialists to receive priority scheduling."
